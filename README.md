# CSC333-Hard-Drive-Capacity

Write a program (Python is *highly preferred*) that does the following:

Read in:
- Platters
- Surfaces per platter
- Tracks per surface
- Sectors per track
- Bytes per sector

Calculate the size of the drive in kb (kilobytes), mb (megabytes), gb (gigabytes), and tb (terrabytes).

Print out the smallest of these that is greater than 1.0, with one fractional digit. For example, 14,333,406,112 would print out as 14.3 GB

Use this to design a multi-terrabyte drive. Note that current drives in the 8TB capacity range typically have six platters. So it's not about platter counr.

Submit the code here, and the specifications of your drive through Brightspace
